Final Thoughts
##############

With this app built from scratch, you should now have a solid idea of how a web applicationm can be built to integrate with the Nutanix APIs.

For further information on the Nutanix REST API versions and the data that is exposed by them, please see the `Nutanix Developer Portal <https://nutanix.dev>`_.  There will you find code samples, documentation and information on everything from the APIs we used today (v3) through to other v3 APIs providing access to Nutanix Calm, Frame and other Nutanix products.

Thanks for attending this lab with us.
