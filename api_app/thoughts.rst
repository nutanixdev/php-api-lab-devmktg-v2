Final Thoughts
##############

With this app built from scratch, you should now have a solid idea of how a web applicationm can be built to integrate with the Nutanix APIs.

For further information on the Nutanix REST API versions and the data that is exposed by them, please see the Nutanix Developer Portal_.  There will you find code samples, documentation and information on everything from the APIs we used today (v1 and v2.0) through to v3 APIs, the current "intentful" API implementation.

Thanks for attending this lab with us.
